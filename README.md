# Smart Glasses - An Intelligent Head Mounted Device

Smart glasses is my academic final year project which was developed using an Arduino Pro Mini and an OLED to display additional information in the user's field of view. The primary objective was to collect as much data as possible for various analytical and survey purposes, hence assisting the general public. This was accomplished with an Android application built using Java that could gather data from databases and process it in order to discover patterns and correlations and provide a legitimate result. The data was then shown on the user's spectacle glass screen. This repository contains the JAva code for the Android application.
